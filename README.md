## 📌 Problem Statement

Hostel maintenance complaints are currently handled through informal communication methods such as WhatsApp messages and phone calls. This often leads to lost requests, delayed responses, lack of transparency, and inefficient coordination between students and hostel staff.

There is no centralized system to log, track, and automate maintenance workflows, resulting in poor operational efficiency and unsatisfactory student experience.

---

## 💡 Our Solution — HostelFlow

**HostelOps** is an automated hostel maintenance workflow system that enables students to digitally submit complaints, automatically assigns them to the appropriate staff, and tracks real-time status from submission to resolution.

The system eliminates manual coordination, improves transparency, and ensures faster complaint resolution.
